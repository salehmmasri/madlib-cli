Make Me A Video Game!

I the {Adjective1} and {Adjective2} {A First Name} have {Past Tense Verb1}{A First Name2}'s {Adjective3} sister and plan to steal her {Adjective} {Plural Noun}!

What are a {Large Animal} and backpacking {Small Animal} to do? Before you can help {A Girl's Name}, you'll have to collect the {Adjective4} {Plural Noun} and {Adjective5} {Plural Noun4} that open up the {Number 1-50} worlds connected to A {First Name's} Lair. There are {Number1} {Plural Noun6} and {Number2} {Plural Noun5} in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
