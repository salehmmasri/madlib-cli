# Description
- Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud.

- Basically the program asks the user to enter different types of words, then reads the sttory text from a file and subtitute the words with what the user entered

# Notes:

- full python script, for the tests I used pytest.
